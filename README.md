##Description
Java based IMAP Server syncing tool (work in progress).

This tool is inspired in [imapsync](http://imapsync.lamiral.info/). mnIMAPSync is still not reliable
you can use it only for testing purposes, if you need a reliable tool it's advised to use imapsync or any
other alternative.

mnIMAPSync can be used to migrate or backup an IMAP account to another either in the same server or
 in different servers. The program can be run standalone (command line interface) or accessed directly 
from java.
